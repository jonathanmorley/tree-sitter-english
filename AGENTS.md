# AGENTS.md

Working notes for this repo. Unsigned commits until just before pushing
(signing happens once, at the end).

## Toolchain (`nix develop`)

- Generate with the pinned CLI, not the flake's:
  `npx -y tree-sitter-cli@0.27.0 generate` (package.json pin).
  The shell's CLI is 0.26.9; generating with it churns only
  `src/tree_sitter/array.h`, so don't.
- Tests: `cargo test --workspace`. Bare `cargo test` at the root only
  covers the root package.
- Lint/format: `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets`,
  `nix fmt`, `nix flake check` — all must be clean.

## The CLI cannot test this grammar

The external scanner is Rust (`bindings/rust/scanner.rs`), which the
tree-sitter CLI cannot link, so `tree-sitter test` / `tree-sitter parse`
do not work. The corpus (`test/corpus/*.txt`) runs under cargo via
`crates/english/tests/corpus.rs` instead.

Beware the stale cache: the CLI caches builds at
`~/.cache/tree-sitter/lib/english.dylib` and will happily pass tests
against a deleted scanner. Delete it if CLI results look suspicious.

## `tree-sitter init --update` is not safe to run blindly

- It duplicated the `let dir` line in `Package.swift` (its Swift
  migration re-applies against its own template output). Always review
  its diff; revert hunks like that one.
- Hand edits in `bindings/rust/lib.rs` (doctest sample, `mod scanner`)
  and `bindings/rust/build.rs` (clippy allow) survive it — the updater
  only patches narrow template sections. Verified, not assumed.
- Upstream template bug: the pyproject `, email = "PARSER_AUTHOR_EMAIL"`
  placeholder constant doesn't match its own
  `{ email = ..., name = ... }` template, so it is never substituted.
  Fixed by hand; a re-run will not re-break it (nor fix it).

## Grammar constraints (learned the hard way)

- `source_file` keeps blank-line `paragraph_break` as a positional
  separator so same-line sentences never split into paragraphs. Making
  the paragraph core optional for empty input is fine, but the trailing
  break repeat must live *inside* the optional — outside it the leading
  and trailing repeats conflict (`source_file_repeat1` ambiguity) and
  `generate` fails. Zero `generate` conflicts is a hard requirement.
- `parenthetical` (plain, no inner end) and `complete_parenthetical`
  (inner end-mark, self-terminated sentence) must stay disjoint by
  construction: plain dies where an end mark appears, complete dies
  without one. Overlap (optional inner end on plain, or plain as a
  sentence alternative) conflicts. Complete takes no trailing closers —
  they would eat its own `)`. One dot cannot serve two levels, so
  dot-inside-parens always consumes the mark inside.
- The typed AST (`crates/english`) covers only nodes the grammar really
  produces (flat clauses; no noun/verb phrases — SVO fields were tried
  upstream and dropped, see `grammar.js` Tier 3).
- Scanner lookahead after the token must use `advance(false)`:
  `advance(true)` past `mark_end` corrupts the token range (observed as
  a zero-length `subordinator`). Same reason the dot/apostrophe/hyphen
  branches advance-then-break: the lexer rewinds to the mark on
  success, so over-consumed tail chars are re-lexed, not lost.
- Corpus tests are TDD: add the failing expectation to
  `test/corpus/*.txt` first. Note the input model: lines strictly
  between the header and `---` are joined verbatim, so N blank lines
  there feed N-1 newlines (single newlines are extras; doubles are
  `paragraph_break`).
- After every `grammar.js` edit, check for duplicate rule keys
  (`grep -n '^    [a-z_]*: \$' grammar.js` must show each once): JS
  silently keeps the last, so a duplicated rule shadows the real one
  and `generate` happily builds the wrong grammar. This has bitten
  three times (`parenthetical`, `clause`, `_sentence_end`).
- Prose audit: `cargo run -p english --example audit -- [files...]`
  counts ERROR/MISSING nodes (with contexts and separate prose vs
  transcription histograms) and diffs `examples/` against `.parse.txt`
  snapshots. Moby-Dick (Gutenberg 2701, kept out of the repo in `/tmp`)
  is the scale corpus, measured from `CHAPTER 1. Loomings.` onward.
  Gutenberg `_`/`*` markup buckets as transcription: it is out of
  grammar scope (an encoding of typography, not prose; the README's
  error-recovery contract already covers it), so only the prose
  histogram measures grammar quality.
- Node iteration (`children()`/`child()`, cursor or index) never yields
  MISSING nodes for hidden-rule aux symbols (e.g.
  `_sentence_end_token1`); only `to_sexp()` shows them. The corpus
  harness compares `to_sexp` output for this reason — a named-only
  walker passes tests that hide recoveries.

## Queued (not started)

- Markup tolerance (later): whether Gutenberg `_`/`*` deserves grammar
  treatment (`extras`, visible nodes, or a documented input pre-pass)
  is deliberately undecided; the audit buckets it as transcription
  until then. Do not let the transcription count drive grammar design.

- Em-dash residuals: leading-dash dialogue, doubled `——` (redaction).

- Em-dash interruptions (~247× on Moby-Dick) and parentheticals
  (~256×): the remaining error budget after hyphens. TDD with corpus
  tests, same as the hyphen slice.

- Statistical POS tagging as a post-parse pass (never grammar rules —
  Tier 3 showed why): DONE v1 (`crates/english-pos` + train binary,
  greedy perceptron on UD English-EWT, dev 91.70% / test 91.79%,
  1.98 MB weights). DONE wiring (`Sentence::tokens` + `split_contraction`

  - `tag_sentence`/`tag_document` in `english-pos/src/wire.rs`; hidden
    punctuation excluded by construction). DONE speed (2026-09-26):
    u64 FNV-1a features + dense `[f32; 17]` rows, zero per-token alloc
    (accuracy bit-identical: 22720/22717); tag 4288→~170 ms on Moby-Dick
    (~450k tok/s, ~17 µs/sentence). DONE incremental:
    `Document::update` (prefix/suffix `InputEdit` + `Tree::edit` before
    reparse — without it reuse reads stale ranges and silently drops
    shifted text) + `TagCache` (sentence-text key, pieces cached);
    one-word-edit keystroke path ≈ 47 ms on book-size input (17 ms
    reparse + 29 ms retag, 10541/1 hit/miss). Bench harness:
    `cargo run --release -p english-pos --example bench -- <file>`.
    Hyperparam note (resolved 2026-09-26): adopted iters=20/min-count=1
    (dev 91.70%/test 91.79%, canonical intact). The sweep peak,
    iters=15/min-count=1 (dev 92.09%/test 91.85%), was rejected: it flips
    canonical "flies" VERB→NOUN (forensics: plural -s/-ies + noun-noun
    t-1 memorization outvotes its single VERB observation in EWT; see
    `forensics` example). w+t-1 and suf+t-1 conjunctions hurt dev at both
    min-counts (sparse-conjunction overfit); neither was adopted. Plain
    (unaveraged) perceptron beat Collins averaging here (33% vs 88%
    pilot) — see train README. Training data stays out of the repo
    (`scripts/fetch-ud.sh` pins revisions: GUM/LinES are CC BY-NC-SA and
    cannot ship here, EWT is CC BY-SA). Multi-treebank concat rejected
    2026-09-26, and mechanical harmonization
    (`scripts/harmonize-ud.mjs`, rules M1–M6 + J3) recovers only ~0.4
    of ~1.9 points — remainder is domain divergence plus deferred items
    (participles, name parts). EWT-only stands; full record in
    `crates/english-pos-train/CANONICAL.md`).

- `Clause::words()` drops subordinators (separate accessor), which
  silently loses tokens for consumers. DONE: `tokens()` iterator
  (`Token`/`TokenKind` over all visible child kinds, parentheticals
  flattened) on `Clause` and `Sentence`; `words()` kept for backcompat.

- `package.json` is still upstream-minimal (no author/repository);
  expanding it to the full canonical template is a node-bindings
  decision, not yet taken.

- Push prep: DONE 2026-09-21 (GitHub remote `origin` created, 38-commit
  stack signed with SSH key, pushed to
  github.com/jonathanmorley/tree-sitter-english). Tangled `upstream`
  push still pending: push-only SSH remote configured, blocked on
  approving `knot.xenolandscapes.com` host keys into known_hosts.
