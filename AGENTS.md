# AGENTS.md

Working notes for this repo. Unsigned commits until just before pushing
(signing happens once, at the end).

## Toolchain (`nix develop`)

- Generate with the pinned CLI, not the flake's:
  `npx -y tree-sitter-cli@0.27.0 generate` (package.json pin).
  The shell's CLI is 0.26.9; generating with it churns only
  `src/tree_sitter/array.h`, so don't.
- Tests: `cargo test --workspace`. Bare `cargo test` at the root only
  covers the root package.
- Lint/format: `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets`,
  `nix fmt`, `nix flake check` — all must be clean.

## The CLI cannot test this grammar

The external scanner is Rust (`bindings/rust/scanner.rs`), which the
tree-sitter CLI cannot link, so `tree-sitter test` / `tree-sitter parse`
do not work. The corpus (`test/corpus/*.txt`) runs under cargo via
`crates/english/tests/corpus.rs` instead.

Beware the stale cache: the CLI caches builds at
`~/.cache/tree-sitter/lib/english.dylib` and will happily pass tests
against a deleted scanner. Delete it if CLI results look suspicious.

## `tree-sitter init --update` is not safe to run blindly

- It duplicated the `let dir` line in `Package.swift` (its Swift
  migration re-applies against its own template output). Always review
  its diff; revert hunks like that one.
- Hand edits in `bindings/rust/lib.rs` (doctest sample, `mod scanner`)
  and `bindings/rust/build.rs` (clippy allow) survive it — the updater
  only patches narrow template sections. Verified, not assumed.
- Upstream template bug: the pyproject `, email = "PARSER_AUTHOR_EMAIL"`
  placeholder constant doesn't match its own
  `{ email = ..., name = ... }` template, so it is never substituted.
  Fixed by hand; a re-run will not re-break it (nor fix it).

## Grammar constraints (learned the hard way)

- `source_file` keeps blank-line `paragraph_break` as a positional
  separator so same-line sentences never split into paragraphs. Making
  the paragraph core optional for empty input is fine, but the trailing
  break repeat must live *inside* the optional — outside it the leading
  and trailing repeats conflict (`source_file_repeat1` ambiguity) and
  `generate` fails. Zero `generate` conflicts is a hard requirement.
- `parenthetical` (plain, no inner end) and `complete_parenthetical`
  (inner end-mark, self-terminated sentence) must stay disjoint by
  construction: plain dies where an end mark appears, complete dies
  without one. Overlap (optional inner end on plain, or plain as a
  sentence alternative) conflicts. Complete takes no trailing closers —
  they would eat its own `)`. One dot cannot serve two levels, so
  dot-inside-parens always consumes the mark inside.
- The typed AST (`crates/english`) covers only nodes the grammar really
  produces (flat clauses; no noun/verb phrases — SVO fields were tried
  upstream and dropped, see `grammar.js` Tier 3).
- Corpus tests are TDD: add the failing expectation to
  `test/corpus/*.txt` first. Note the input model: lines strictly
  between the header and `---` are joined verbatim, so N blank lines
  there feed N-1 newlines (single newlines are extras; doubles are
  `paragraph_break`).
- Prose audit: `cargo run -p english --example audit -- [files...]`
  counts ERROR/MISSING nodes (with contexts and separate prose vs
  transcription histograms) and diffs `examples/` against `.parse.txt`
  snapshots. Moby-Dick (Gutenberg 2701, kept out of the repo in `/tmp`)
  is the scale corpus, measured from `CHAPTER 1. Loomings.` onward.
  Gutenberg `_`/`*` markup buckets as transcription: it is out of
  grammar scope (an encoding of typography, not prose; the README's
  error-recovery contract already covers it), so only the prose
  histogram measures grammar quality.
- Node iteration (`children()`/`child()`, cursor or index) never yields
  MISSING nodes for hidden-rule aux symbols (e.g.
  `_sentence_end_token1`); only `to_sexp()` shows them. The corpus
  harness compares `to_sexp` output for this reason — a named-only
  walker passes tests that hide recoveries.

## Queued (not started)

- Markup tolerance (later): whether Gutenberg `_`/`*` deserves grammar
  treatment (`extras`, visible nodes, or a documented input pre-pass)
  is deliberately undecided; the audit buckets it as transcription
  until then. Do not let the transcription count drive grammar design.
- Em-dash residuals: leading-dash dialogue, doubled `——` (redaction).

- Em-dash interruptions (~247× on Moby-Dick) and parentheticals
  (~256×): the remaining error budget after hyphens. TDD with corpus
  tests, same as the hyphen slice.
- Statistical POS tagging as a post-parse pass (never grammar rules —
  Tier 3 showed why). Train offline, preferably with a Rust training
  binary in the workspace (perceptron; UD English-EWT corpus, which is
  freely available with standard splits — not Treebank, which is
  LDC-licensed). Python only if feature experimentation demands it.
  Export weight tables; pure-Rust inference crate with an accuracy
  harness. Phrases become projections over tagged flat clauses.
- `package.json` is still upstream-minimal (no author/repository);
  expanding it to the full canonical template is a node-bindings
  decision, not yet taken.
- Push prep: create the GitHub remote, sign the stack, push.
